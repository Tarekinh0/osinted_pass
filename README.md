# osinted_pass
Password generator fueled by the information you gathered by using OSINT on the target.

You can input the person's information, his husband/wife's information, input wether he has kids, pets or not. And finally add any more information that could be relevant by adding another person, date, place, or any other string (company name, hobbies, favourite football team...) that could help identify the password of the victim.

You will have to chose whether you want a light, medium or heavy wordlist.

Caution : when inputing a lot of information about the target, you can end up with more than 35 Million different passwords with the heavy mode, that's about 700 MB for 30 minutes of processing. Make sure you have the time and ressourses needed before launching the heavy mode.

Finally, it is worth noting that the contributors to this project are not responsible for misusage of this tool.
This tool was made for educational purposes but was also made to raise awareness on the importance of a robust impersonnal password.
Do not misuse this tool !
